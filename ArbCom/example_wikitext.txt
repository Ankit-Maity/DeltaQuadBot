This is an alphabetically sorted list of editors who have voted. It will be updated periodically during the election. The earlier logs may be found in the article history. The real time log from which this data derives is at: [[Special:SecurePoll/list/80]].

The updating process is designed to leave discussions intact, so you may discuss the voters below (for example, if questions arise about a voter's eligibility).
